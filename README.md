# Project 0


I have made a website for people to know various college events happening across the campus.
This is a concise website. I have not implemented all the features as I have to complete the course before June 30, but I have fulfilled all the requirements of the project.

Page 1- Login page - It has only CSS file remaining all other page has its SCSS file also.
Page 2 -Upcoming Event list 
Page 3 - Today events table with full details
Page 4 - Sign Up page.

One can reach from any page to any other page via a different hyperlink.
